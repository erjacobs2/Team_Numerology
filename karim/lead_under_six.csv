* Percentages flagged with an asterisk (*) should be interpreted with caution since they are based on less than 20 EBLLs and the percent elevated can change dramatically with the addition or subtraction of one EBLL.
This query uses both a birth year and test year approach. Data for birth year (cohort method) determine how many children born in a specific year were tested before 3 years old and how many of those tested had an elevated blood lead level. Data for test year (annual method) determine how many children were tested in that year in the specific age group and how many of those tested had an elevated blood lead level.
Lead testing is not universal in Minnesota. Children with risk factors for lead exposure (such as older housing or poverty status) are targeted for testing. Because lead testing is not universal the 'percent elevated' indicator cannot be generalized for the overall population of children living in Minnesota.
There is no safe level of exposure to lead. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now uses a reference level of 5 micrograms per deciliter (5 mcg/dL) to identify children with blood lead levels that are much higher than most children.
