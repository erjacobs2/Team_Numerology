Data on children without health insurance are available for both sexes combined from 2006-present only.
Due to a substantial change in methodology the U.S. Census Bureau does not recommend comparing 2005-2007 data to 2008-onward.
When comparing county estimates confidence intervals should be used with caution because the model-based estimates result in correlated percentages.

Household income is calculated using all sources of individual income including all individuals residing together who are related. Median household income means that half of all households have a higher annual income and half are lower than the median income.
When comparing county estimates confidence intervals should be used with caution because the model-based estimates result in correlated percentages.

Poverty is defined here by comparing a household's annual income to a set of federal poverty thresholds as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau. Both 100% and 185% thresholds are shown. In 2014 for example a two adult two child household below the 100% poverty threshold had an annual income below $24008 (and below the 185% poverty threshold if less than $44415 in annual income).
